# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ECOLENS Backend is a comprehensive Node.js/Express API server that powers the ECOLENS AI climate visualization platform. It serves as the orchestration layer between the React frontend, AI/ML services, and climate datasets, providing authentication, data management, AI integration, and computer vision capabilities for climate change analysis and prediction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register and authenticate with the platform, so that I can access personalized climate analysis features and save my simulation results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits registration data THEN the system SHALL validate the input and create a new user account with encrypted password
2. WHEN a user attempts to login with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token for authentication
3. WHEN a user accesses protected routes with a valid JWT token THEN the system SHALL authorize the request and return user profile data
4. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages with proper HTTP status codes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access global and country-specific CO₂ emission data, so that I can understand historical climate trends and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests global CO₂ data THEN the system SHALL return historical emission trends with years and emission values
2. WHEN a user requests country-specific CO₂ data with a valid country code THEN the system SHALL return that country's emission history
3. WHEN a user requests data for an invalid country code THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
4. WHEN the system processes data requests THEN it SHALL format responses consistently with proper data structures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to get AI-powered predictions about future CO₂ levels and ask climate-related questions, so that I can understand potential future scenarios and get expert insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests CO₂ predictions for a specific country and time period THEN the system SHALL use ML models to generate future emission projections
2. WHEN a user asks a climate-related question in natural language THEN the system SHALL integrate with AI APIs (Gemini/GPT/DeepSeek) to provide data-backed answers
3. WHEN AI services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide fallback responses
4. WHEN processing AI requests THEN the system SHALL validate input parameters and sanitize responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload images for computer vision analysis, so that I can estimate the CO₂ impact of objects like vehicles, factories, or forests in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image file THEN the system SHALL process it through computer vision models to detect emission-related objects
2. WHEN the CV analysis completes THEN the system SHALL return detected objects, estimated impact level, and confidence scores
3. WHEN an invalid image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate validation errors
4. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL handle file size limits and supported formats properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access visualization data for charts and timelines, so that I can see climate data presented in an interactive and understandable format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests timeline data for a specific country THEN the system SHALL return formatted data suitable for chart visualization
2. WHEN processing visualization requests THEN the system SHALL aggregate data from multiple sources into consistent formats
3. WHEN data is unavailable for a requested region THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback data or error messages
4. WHEN returning visualization data THEN the system SHALL optimize response size and structure for frontend consumption

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to be scalable, secure, and maintainable, so that it can handle growing user loads and integrate with external services reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize all required services, database connections, and external API integrations
2. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling, logging, and security middleware
3. WHEN integrating with external APIs THEN the system SHALL manage API keys securely and handle rate limiting
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs and sanitize outputs to prevent security vulnerabilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to have a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, so that it's easy to maintain, test, and extend with new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the backend THEN the system SHALL follow MVC architecture with separate controllers, services, and models
2. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL separate routes, middleware, utilities, and configuration into distinct modules
3. WHEN handling data operations THEN the system SHALL use a consistent repository pattern for database interactions
4. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive error handling and input validation
